# Contributing to The Self-Sustaining Food Synthesizer

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is an ambitious open-source project, and we welcome all forms of help, from code and design to documentation and community support.

Please take a moment to review this document to make the contribution process smooth and effective for everyone.

## How Can I Help?

We need expertise in several key areas:

### 1. Engineering & Prototyping
*   **Electrical Engineering:** Design and optimize the solar power system, battery management, and sensor networks.
*   **Mechanical Engineering:** Design the automated growth chamber, harvesting mechanisms, and the synthesis module's physical components.
*   **Mechatronics/Robotics:** Help integrate mechanical systems with electronic controls.

### 2. Software & AI
*   **Python Developers:** Build the core AI control system, data logging, and device orchestration.
*   **Embedded Systems (C++/Arduino):** Program microcontrollers for real-time sensor monitoring and control (temperature, humidity, pumps).
*   **UI/UX Design:** Help design the simple touchscreen interface for users.

### 3. Biology & Food Science
*   **Mycology:** Expertise in optimizing oyster mushroom growth conditions, substrates, and contamination prevention.
*   **Food Science:** Develop recipes for the synthesis module, focusing on nutrition, texture, and flavor.

### 4. Community & Documentation
*   **Technical Writers:** Help improve documentation, tutorials, and guides.
*   **Community Moderators:** Help manage discussions and support new contributors.
