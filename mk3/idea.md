### **Mk3: The TerraFountain - A Blueprint for a Self-Sustaining Water System**

The Mk3 "TerraFountain" is our most ambitious project yet. It's not a machine you simply plug in; it's a living ecosystem designed to solve one of humanity's most pressing problems. This document outlines the conceptual blueprint for a functional prototype, maintaining the open-source and modular philosophy of the Mk2.

The goal is to engineer a system that is fully integrated and self-sustaining, providing an endless supply of purified water using a groundbreaking fusion of mycology and engineering.

### **1. General Blueprint & Orientation**

The Mk3 TerraFountain is an inverted system, with its primary function occurring underground. The overall structure is a combination of subterranean chambers and a small surface-level intake tower.

* **The Surface Component:** A low-profile, solar-panelled tower that houses the intake fans and the AI control unit. It's designed to be inconspicuous and resilient to desert environments.
* **The Subterranean Component:** This is the heart of the system. It consists of a large, insulated chamber where the fungal network resides. Below this chamber is a collection reservoir and a final purification unit. This entire section is fully sealed and designed for long-term, low-maintenance operation.

### **2. Prototype Materials List & Estimated Costs**

This list is for a small-scale, experimental prototype suitable for a backyard or educational setting. Costs are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and are estimates.

#### **A. Subterranean Bio-Reactor Array**
* **Structural Material:** Two large, food-grade plastic barrels or tanks (e.g., 200L) with sealed lids. One for the main chamber, the other for the reservoir.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $200
* **Lining Material:** A moisture-permeable but sealed geomembrane (e.g., a pond liner) to line the interior of the Bio-Reactor chamber.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $50 - $100
* **Mycelial Inoculation:** Spores or a small culture of a known hydrophilic fungi (research needed for specific strain).
    * **Estimated Cost:** $50 - $150
* **Substrate:** A sterile substrate for the fungi to grow on, likely a mix of sawdust and gypsum.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $40

#### **B. Atmospheric Intake & Condensation System**
* **Intake Fans:** 2 x high-efficiency, solar-powered fans with ducting.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $250
* **Intake Pipes:** Insulated PVC or metal pipes to run from the surface fans down into the subterranean chamber.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $40 - $80
* **Air Filters:** Simple HEPA or mesh filters to prevent dust from entering the system.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $30
* **Geothermal Heat Exchanger:** A simple coil of buried copper tubing to pre-cool the intake air.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $50 - $100

#### **C. Myco-Harvesting & Purification System**
* **Acoustic Emitters:** A set of 2-4 small, low-frequency sound emitters (piezoelectric transducers).
    * **Function:** To vibrate the fungi and release water.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $40 - $80
* **Water Collection Tray:** A large, sloped, food-grade plastic tray to catch the released water and guide it to the reservoir.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $40
* **Purification Unit:** A small UV-C light sterilizer and a simple reverse osmosis filter.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $150 - $300
* **Water Pump:** A small, low-power submersible pump to move water to the final outlet.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $20 - $50

#### **D. AI & Power Management**
* **Microcontroller:** An ESP32 or Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi capability.
    * **Function:** Manages sensors, fan speed, and harvesting cycles.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $30 - $60
* **Sensor Array:**
    * **Humidity & Temperature Sensors:** Multiple sensors for both the intake and the subterranean chamber.
    * **Water Level Sensor:** To monitor the level in the reservoir.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $30 - $60
* **Power System:** A small solar panel (e.g., 20-50W) with a charge controller and a Li-ion battery pack.
    * **Estimated Cost:** $100 - $200

### **Blueprint & Build Structure**

1.  **Dig the Chamber:** Excavate the site for the subterranean chamber and reservoir. Line the hole with a waterproofing material (e.g., pond liner).
2.  **Install the Bio-Reactor:** Place the main Bio-Reactor barrel and reservoir barrel in the chamber. Run the intake and output pipes.
3.  **Inoculate the Fungi:** In a sterile environment, prepare the substrate and inoculate it with the hydrophilic fungi. Transfer the substrate into the Bio-Reactor barrel.
4.  **Install Electronics:** Mount the microcontroller, sensors, and power management system. Run all the necessary wiring.
5.  **Build the Intake System:** Construct the solar panel frame on the surface and mount the fans. Attach the intake pipes and run them down to the Bio-Reactor.
6.  **Setup Harvesting & Purification:** Place the acoustic emitters inside the chamber. Install the collection tray and the purification unit. Connect the final output pipe to the surface.
7.  **Seal and Activate:** Once all systems are in place, seal the chamber. Power on the unit and begin the first harvesting cycle.
