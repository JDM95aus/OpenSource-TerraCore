This new project is the Mk3 "AquaCrab". It integrates the lessons from the Mk2 (mobile robotics) and the Mk3 (water generation) into a single, compact, and highly autonomous unit.

Here is the new, fully integrated blueprint, materials list, and cost breakdown to match the image and description of the Mk3 "AquaCrab" prototype.

Mk3: The AquaCrab - A Blueprint for a Self-Contained Ecosystem
The AquaCrab is a fully integrated, mobile unit designed to autonomously navigate challenging terrains while generating its own food and water. It is a single, self-contained ecosystem that proves the fusion of mycology and robotics can be portable.

1. General Blueprint & Orientation
The AquaCrab's structure is a single, sealed, chassis-based system. The entire unit is built around a central, transparent Bio-Core, which serves as the hub for all biological and mechanical processes.

Chassis & Mobility: A sealed, waterproof body made from a custom-fabricated plastic or aluminum frame. It uses four or six large, durable wheels designed to traverse soft ground and mud.

The Bio-Core: A clear, sealed, central pod that contains the water generation and food synthesis components. It has two distinct chambers:

The Myco-Gen Chamber: The upper half, where hydrophilic fungi are grown for atmospheric water generation.

The Myco-Synth Chamber: The lower half, where food synthesis takes place using the mushroom paste.

Sensory Hub: A centralized mast or hub on top of the unit that houses the primary AI cameras, sensors, and communication antennas.

2. Prototype Materials List & Estimated Costs
This list is tailored for a mobile prototype. Costs are in Australian Dollars (AUD) and are rough estimates.

A. Chassis & Mobility
Chassis Material: Sheets of marine-grade plywood, HDPE plastic, or aluminum composite panel for a waterproof hull.

Estimated Cost: $80 - $200

Wheels & Motors: 4-6 large, all-terrain robotic wheels with sealed hubs. High-torque, waterproof DC motors (e.g., 24V brushed or brushless motors) and sealed gearboxes.

Estimated Cost: $250 - $500

Waterproofing: Silicone sealant, gaskets, and waterproof enclosures for electronics.

Estimated Cost: $30 - $60

B. Bio-Core & Life Support
Acrylic Tubing/Sheets: Clear, sealed acrylic for the Bio-Core chamber.

Estimated Cost: $60 - $120

Fungal Supplies: Spore culture and substrate for both hydrophilic and food-synthesis fungi.

Estimated Cost: $40 - $80

Internal Fans: 2 x small, waterproof 5V fans for air circulation.

Estimated Cost: $15 - $30

Nutrient Injection System: A small, multi-channel peristaltic pump and a nutrient reservoir.

Estimated Cost: $80 - $150

Myco-Harvesting: Miniature piezoelectric emitters and a sloped collection tray inside the chamber.

Estimated Cost: $40 - $80

C. Electronics & Sensors
Microcontroller: An industrial-grade microcontroller (e.g., ESP32 or Teensy with a robust casing).

Estimated Cost: $40 - $80

Sensor Array:

Environmental: BME280 sensor for internal temp/humidity.

Navigation: Ultrasonic distance sensors, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for orientation, and a waterproof camera for visual navigation.

Moisture & Water: A moisture sensor for the substrate and a simple float sensor for the water reservoir.

Estimated Cost: $100 - $200

Power System: A high-capacity Li-ion or LiPo battery pack. A small, on-board solar panel to supplement the charge.

Estimated Cost: $150 - $300

Total Estimated Cost: $950 - $1,900 AUD
Blueprint & Build Structure
Chassis Assembly: Cut and fabricate the waterproof chassis. Install the motors and wheels, ensuring a tight seal to prevent water ingress.

Bio-Core Construction: Build the transparent, dual-chamber Bio-Core. Install the internal fans, lights, and harvest tray.

Electronics Integration: Mount the microcontroller and all sensors inside a waterproof enclosure within the chassis.

Mycology & Life Support: In a sterile environment, prepare the substrates and inoculate the fungi in their respective chambers. Install the nutrient injection pump and tubing.

Final Assembly & Sealing: Mount the Bio-Core onto the chassis. Route all wiring through waterproof glands. Attach the wheels and secure all hatches.

First Deployment: Power on the unit. Calibrate the AI and sensors, and begin autonomous navigation and synthesis tests in a controlled, muddy environment.
