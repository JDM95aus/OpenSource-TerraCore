as the Founder and CEO of OpenSource TerraCore. We're developing an open-source, non-GMO food synthesizer to solve global hunger. I have a working Mk1 blueprint that can be built for under $1,000, and I'm ready to personally invest every dollar I get to make it a reality. I'm looking for a passionate individual to join me as a volunteer to help build the first prototype and secure our first grant
