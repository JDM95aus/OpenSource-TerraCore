Core Principle: "We build with open hands, not closed fists. Our technology, our knowledge, and our community remain accessible to all who share our commitment to human dignity through abundance."

ARTICLE I: FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

1.1 The Three Pillars of Open Hand

```
TRANSPARENCY OVER OBSCURITY
- All technical specifications remain publicly accessible
- No hidden functionalities or intentional obfuscation
- Development occurs in public view
- Decisions are documented and justified publicly

COOPERATION OVER COMPETITION
- Collaborative development preferred over proprietary advantage
- Credit shared among contributors
- Knowledge transfer as default, not exception
- Success measured by ecosystem growth, not market share

ABUNDANCE OVER SCARCITY
- Technology designed for maximum accessibility
- No artificial limitations on production or use
- Value created through utility, not artificial scarcity
- Wealth measured by community prosperity
```

1.2 The Sovereignty Balance

```
INDIVIDUAL SOVEREIGNTY:

When in doubt, err toward:
- More access over less
- More sharing over less
- More capability over less
- More sovereignty over less
```

10.2 Living Document

```
This Code of Conduct is a living document that grows with our community. 
Its strength comes not from rigid enforcement but from shared commitment 
to the principles of open hands building open futures.

The ultimate authority is not these words, but our shared dedication to 
a world where no one goes hungry when the means to feed everyone exists 
in the public domain.

We are the architects of abundance. We build with open hands.
