OpenSourceTerraCore Countertop Synthesizer: Final Miniaturized Design

External Dimensions: 60cm (W) x 50cm (D) x 40cm (H) 

1. Core Components & Their Miniaturization

A. The "Fuel Pod" - Pre-Grown Mycelium Block

· What it is: Instead of growing mushrooms inside the machine, you use a removable, 2-liter, hermetically sealed plastic tub of fully colonized oyster mushroom substrate. This is the "K-Cup" for the system. You buy it pre-grown or grow it yourself externally.
· Function: Provides the base "food ink" material. This removes the need for the entire cultivation chamber and robotic harvester.

B. The Integrated Grinder & Pasteurizer

· Location: Top-left of the internal chassis.
· Process:
  1. You open a small door and insert the entire "Fuel Pod."
  2. The machine's internal auger grinds the entire block—mycelium and substrate—into a coarse paste.
  3. This paste is immediately pushed through a heated tube, instantly pasteurizing it at 75°C to kill any contaminants.
     This removes the need for a separate soil filter and cleaning system.

C. The Miniaturized 3-Cartridge System

· Location: A slide-out tray on the front of the machine, below the main door.
· Cartridges:
  · Nutrition Cartridge: 100g (Enough for 10+ meals)
  · Flavor Cartridge: 50g (Enough for 10+ meals)
  · Color Cartridge: A single, combined CMYK cartridge with 40g total gel.
· This is a huge space saving over individual color cartridges.

D. The 3D Printer & Cooking Chamber

· Location: The main central cavity.
· Design: A standard 3D printer mechanism (X-Y-Z gantry) mounted upside-down from the top of the cavity.
· The print head is the Mixing Nozzle. It has:
  · Inlets for the pasteurized mushroom paste, nutrition, flavor, and color.
  · A static mixer to combine them instantly.
  · A heated nozzle that deposits and simultaneously cooks the food onto the build plate.
· The build plate is a non-stick, heated surface.

E. The Control Panel

· Location: On the front, above the main door.
· Components: A 7-inch touchscreen and a single "Start/Stop" button.

2. The Exact User Workflow

1. PREP: User buys or grows a "Fuel Pod" (mycelium block) externally.
2. LOAD: User opens the front door, places the Fuel Pod into the designated slot, and closes the door.
3. SELECT: On the touchscreen, user selects a recipe (e.g., "Protein Pasta, Rosemary Garlic, Brown Color").
4. SYNTHESIZE: User presses "Start."
   · The machine grinds and pasteurizes the Fuel Pod.
   · The paste is fed to the print head.
   · The cartridges inject precise amounts of supplements.
   · The printer head mixes everything and prints/cooks the meal in 5-10 minutes.
5. RETRIEVE: The main door unlocks. The user opens it and removes the finished, cooked meal from the build plate.
