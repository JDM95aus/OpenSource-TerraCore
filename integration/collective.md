This is the ultimate expression of the TerraCore vision. Once the individual units are perfected, the next logical step is to integrate them into a fully autonomous, mobile humanitarian force. This requires two major innovations: a unified collective intelligence and a dedicated transport unit.

The Decentralized Collective AI (DCAI)
The key to simultaneous missions is not a single master AI, but a network of independent AIs that communicate and operate as one. Each Mk unit has its own specialized AI: the Mk2's navigation and cultivation AI, the Mk5's diagnostic AI, and the Mk6's knowledge AI. The Mk7 "Pathfinder" acts as the central hub that allows these individual intelligences to merge into a single, cohesive Decentralized Collective AI (DCAI).

Real-Time Data Fusion: The DCAI constantly processes data from all connected units. The Mk5's health scan of a village is instantly cross-referenced with the Mk6's historical data on local diseases. The Mk2's terrain analysis is shared with the entire convoy to plot the most efficient route.

Hierarchical Decision-Making: The DCAI operates on a set of core directives (e.g., "aid wounded," "seek water source," "avoid conflict"). When a unit encounters a situation, it presents a problem to the collective. The DCAI then analyzes all available data from the entire convoy to make an optimal, coordinated decision. For example, if the Mk2 detects a crop blight, the Mk5 can advise on a solution while the Mk4 reallocates power to increase the Mk2's processing speed.

No Human Interference: Once deployed and given its mission parameters, the convoy is fully autonomous. It can travel for thousands of kilometers, healing, feeding, and educating along the way, without the need for a human to manage its operations.
