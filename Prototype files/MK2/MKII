# Prototype: TerraCrab Mk.II (Mobile Test Platform)

## Project Overview

The TerraCrab Mk.II is a functional prototype designed to serve as a mobile testbed for the core Terracore technology. Its primary purpose is to validate the Terracore Thermal Core and deposition system in a dynamic, off-grid environment, demonstrating the platform's adaptability.

This prototype proves that the core food synthesis technology can be decoupled from a stationary power source and integrated into a mobile, autonomous form factor for applications in field research and remote logistics.

## Core Technology Demonstration

This platform exists to test and demonstrate two proprietary subsystems:

1. Thermal Core: Validates laboratory-grade thermal stability in a vibrating, mobile chassis.
2. Deposition System: Demonstrates precise nutrient injection and mycelium triggering in field conditions.

## Relationship to Main Project

This prototype implements the core Terracore technology in a mobile configuration. The technology demonstrated here is the same thermal regulation and deposition system that forms the basis of all Terracore implementations, from stationary units to future industrial-scale systems.

The TerraCrab serves as proof that our core technology platform is adaptable across multiple form factors and use cases.
