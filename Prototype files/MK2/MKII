Phase 1: The Bio-Core (Precision Living Engine)
Vessel/Housing:
CNC-machined aluminum or high-grade sealed enclosure for superior thermal stability.
Environmental Control, Temperature: Functional Peltier array providing precise thermal modulation under code: ($\mathbf{\pm 0.5^{\circ}C}$ control).
Humidity: High-flow, industrial ultrasonic mister with active dehumidification for reliable $\mathbf{85\%-95\%}$ RH maintenance.
CO2/FAE: Research-grade NDIR CO2 sensor controls a solenoid-driven fresh air exchange system for high-accuracy gas management.
Substrate & Waste Loop (Functional):
A miniature, isolated Microbial Compost Unit is integrated to process spent mushroom tissue.
The unit converts organic waste into a sterilized, reusable nutrient slurry for the mycelial substrate.

Phase 2: Chassis and Mobility System (Industrial Grade)

Structure:
Components manufactured from carbon-fiber reinforced plastic or lightweight aluminum alloy.
Design ensures environmental sealing for field operation.

Mobility:
Six articulated legs powered by 12 \times \text{Brushless DC Motors with integrated encoders (self implimented or through Fonzcorp).
Provides high-torque, precise, and energy-efficient autonomous movement.
Energy Harvesting (Functional Piezoelectric):
Piezoelectric film is fully integrated into all 12 leg joints.
Mechanical energy from motion is actively harvested and fed back to the main battery.

Phase 3: AI and Sensory Integration (High-Fidelity)
AI Processing:
SBC runs a dedicated Neural Network model for processing complex sensor data.
Primary AI directive is to interpret mycelial signals and optimize all system parameters.
Bio-Sensing (Precision Data):
A dense array of low-noise, platinum micro-electrodes is integrated with a professional-grade signal conditioning circuit.
Measures electrical resistance and potential to log complex fungal signals.
Vibrational Alteration:
High-fidelity, low-frequency haptic transducers are mounted to the Bio-Core frame.
AI sends targeted, algorithmic vibrational patterns to test growth and direction influence.
Navigation Sensors:
