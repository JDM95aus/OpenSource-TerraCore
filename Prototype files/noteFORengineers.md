# Project Terracore: Global Mission & Development Framework

## Our Mission: Decentralized Survival Technology

We are developing open-source blueprints for decentralized, zero-waste physical utilities that provide renewable power, water, and food. This is pre-emptive infrastructure for resource-scarce futures.

## Current Status: Advanced R&D Phase

Treat this as serious research and development, not a completed solution. While designs are engineered to function, this remains experimental.

## The Three-Tier Development Framework

### MK.I: TerraCore Physical Node
Function: Foundational modular unit for local resource independence
Capabilities: Power generation, water recycling, bio-waste conversion
Engineering Focus: Extreme durability, minimal maintenance, system interoperability

Prototype Funding Requirements:
- Basic Functional Prototype: $35,000 - $50,000 USD
- Advanced Certified System: $100,000 - $150,000 USD

### MK.II: TerraCred Blockchain Engine
Function: Digital-physical hybrid system and supply-chain backbone
Capabilities: Contribution tokenization, transparent resource tracking
Development Focus: Smart contract security, verifiable contribution mechanisms

### MK.III: TerraNet AI Optimization Layer
Function: Proprietary SaaS for network optimization and security
Capabilities: Predictive maintenance, efficiency optimization, compliance
Development Focus: Machine learning models, edge computing, security protocols

## Permanent Contribution Legacy

Every significant contribution, commit, and design amendment will be permanently recorded in the OpenSourceTerraCore.org foundation history. This is your non-dilutable legacy to global infrastructure.
