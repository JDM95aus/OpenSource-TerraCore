# Project Terracore: mk1 mycellium starter kit

## The Vision: Food Security for Everyone
The Mk1 is designed to be built by anyone, anywhere, with minimal tools and budget. This is the grassroots foundation of the Terracore project - proving that resilient food technology doesn't require fancy labs or big budgets.

## Total Cost: Under $150 USD
Yes, you read that right. Everything here can be sourced from local hardware stores, online marketplaces, or even repurposed from household items.

## Core Components & Sourcing

### 1. Thermal Chamber & Structure ($35-50)
- Insulated Box: Used styrofoam cooler or cardboard box with bubble wrap insulation
- Heat Source: 25W incandescent light bulb or reptile heating cable ($5-15)
- Temperature Control: Simple thermostat from pet supply store ($8-12)
- Container: 5-gallon food-grade bucket with lid ($3-5)

### 2. Basic Environmental Control ($25-40)
- Humidity: Small USB-powered humidifier or manual spray bottle ($5-15)
- Air Exchange: Computer fan from old PC or 5V USB fan ($2-5)
- Monitoring: Analog thermometer/hygrometer from hardware store ($3-5)

### 3. Simple Deposition System ($15-25)
- Manual Injection: Large medical syringe or condiment bottle ($2-5)
- Mixing: Kitchen blender or jar with shaking ($0-5)
- Measurement: Kitchen measuring cups and spoons ($0-5)

### 4. Biological Materials ($20-30)
- Mycelium: Oyster mushroom grow kit or spore syringe ($10-20)
- Substrate: Straw, coffee grounds, or pasteurized sawdust ($5-10)
- Nutrients: Molasses or corn syrup from grocery store ($2-5)

### 5. Power & Control ($15-25)
- Power: USB power bank or old phone charger ($5-15)
- Timer: Simple outlet timer for light/fan cycles ($5-10)
- Wiring: Basic electrical tape and extension cord ($2-5)

## Build Philosophy

### No Special Tools Required
- Basic screwdriver set
- Box cutter or utility knife
- Tape (duct tape, electrical tape)
- Scissors
- Marker for measurements

### Repurposing First
Every component can be found secondhand, recycled, or repurposed. The goal is zero barriers to entry.

## What It Proves

This ultra-low-cost version demonstrates that the core Terracore principles work without complex technology:
- Mycelium can be triggered to rapid growth with simple nutrient injection
- Basic thermal management enables food production in variable environments
- The system can be built and operated by anyone, anywhere

## Success Metrics for Mk1
- Produces edible mushrooms within 2-3 weeks
- Maintains 70-80% humidity with daily attention
- Operates on less than $1/week electricity
- Can be built in one afternoon with local materials

## Why This Matters
The Mk1 isn't just a prototype - it's a proof that food sovereignty can start in your backyard, your apartment, or your community center. No patents, no corporate control, just people feeding people.

Build it. Share it. Improve it. This is how we change the system from the ground up.
