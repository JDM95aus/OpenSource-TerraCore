Official Project Repository: https://github.com/JDM95aus/OpenSource-TerraCore
Live Website: https://opensourceterracore.org

Project Overview
TerraCore is an open-source, solar-powered food synthesis system designed to produce edible biomass using triggered mycelium growth. The system achieves laboratory-grade thermal stability in field environments.

Project Originator: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk (ABN: 80662917463)

Current Status
Active commercial partnership discussions underway
Seeking academic validation from leading research institutions
Developing commercial licensing framework
Prototype designs complete, preparing for professional CAD development

Immediate Goal
Secure development funding to produce professional CAD blueprints and formalize the Terracore Thermal Core technology.

Core Technology
Terracore Thermal Core: Hermetically sealed thermal regulation system maintaining ±0.5°C stability using biomass gasifier as primary heat source
Rapid Deposition System: Triggers hibernating mycelium to produce edible biomass within minutes
Platform Architecture: Core technology adaptable to multiple form factors (stationary, mobile, industrial)

Prototype Variants
MK1 "Backyard Builder": Ultra-low-cost rapid synthesis system (<$300 AUD)
Terracore Alpha: Stationary wall-powered appliance prototype
TerraCrab MK.II: Mobile autonomous platform for field testing
