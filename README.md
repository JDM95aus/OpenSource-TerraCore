TerraCore: Open-Source Solar Food Synthesizer

Official Website: https://opensourceterracore.org

Project Overview
TerraCore is an open-source, solar-powered food synthesis system that produces edible mushroom biomass in minutes using triggered mycelium growth.

Project Originator: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk (ABN: 80662917463)

Current Status
Active commercial partnership discussions underway
Seeking academic validation from leading research institutions  
Developing commercial licensing framework
Prototype designs complete, preparing for professional CAD development

Immediate Goal
Secure development funding to produce professional CAD blueprints and formalize the Terracore Thermal Core technology.

Core Technology
All TerraCore systems use the same core synthesis process:
Triggered mycelium growth producing edible mushrooms in minutes
Terracore Thermal Core maintaining precise thermal stability
Solar-powered operation with biomass backup

Prototype Variants
MK1: Affordable backyard builder version
MK2 TerraCrab: Mobile autonomous platform version
Both produce food using identical synthesis technology
