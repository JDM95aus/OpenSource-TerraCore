THE BUILD:
PROJECT OVERVIEW Originator/IP Holder: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk 
(ABN: 80662917463)
Final Asset Owner: Licensor (J.R Dakin-Mandryk)
Deployment Goal: Verify scientific viability and collect baseline performance data (90-day test phase).
Status: Design Finalized (Ready for Fabrication and Assembly)
Estimated cost: $10,000 AUD

 SECTION 1: SYSTEM DEFINITION & DELIVERABLES
The MK.II Terra-Crab must be built as a singular, unified system where the primary function is zero-waste thermal and electrical conversion. The successful completion of this SOW is defined by the following two deliverables:
1.1. Final Physical Deliverable
One (1) fully assembled, tested, and operational MK.II Terra-Crab prototype unit.
The final asset must be delivered to the Licensor upon successful completion of the 90-day testing phase.
1.2. Required Data Deliverable
A complete log of performance data over a minimum 72-hour continuous test cycle.
Verification of the Thermal Control Target (see Section 2.1).
Verification of Net Electrical Output (2.5 kW sustained).
Verification of Water Recapture Rate (minimum 90% efficiency).
SECTION 2: CORE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
The prototype must meet Industrial Grade requirements. Components are non-negotiable substitutes for existing, high-fidelity parts.
2.1. Environmental Precision & Bio-Reactor (The Myco-Forge Core)
Thermal Control: Must sustain a precise control of ¬±0.5‚àòC (Target range: 22‚àòC‚àí28‚àòC).
Implementation: Requires integration of a functional Peltier Array system, synchronized with the control loop.
Atmosphere Monitoring: Requires integration of a research-grade NDIR CO2‚Äã Sensor and solenoid-driven Fresh Air Exchange (FAE).
Syngas / Lysis: Must integrate an Ultrasonic Transducer or a High-RPM Shear Mixer as the Molecular Editing Head.
Function: Must achieve rapid Cell Lysis and Homogenization of the mushroom paste.
2.2. Electronics, AI, and Sensing
Processing Core: Must implement a dedicated Single Board Computer (SBC) (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent) capable of running a Neural Network model for autonomous function.
FonzCorp Panel: Must feature the standardized multi-pin connector and support the required diagnostic input sequence (as per Term Sheet).
Mycelial Sensing: Requires integration of a dense array of low-noise, Platinum Micro-electrodes and a dedicated signal conditioning circuit.
Function: Essential for collecting complex fungal electrical data (the primary research objective).
2.3. Mobility and Chassis
Mobility System: Must be driven by 12√óBrushless DC Motors (6-Leg Articulation), with integrated encoders for precise positioning.
Energy Harvesting: Requires functional integration of Piezoelectric Film into all 12 leg joints.
Function: Must prove the zero-point propulsion principle and supplemental power generation during locomotion.
Material: The chassis must utilize Carbon-Fiber Reinforced Plastic or Lightweight Aluminum Alloy.
