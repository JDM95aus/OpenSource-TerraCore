**TerraCoreâ„¢** is an open-source, solar-powered system that grows and synthesizes food from mushroom biomass. This project aims to decentralize food production and end dependency on industrial agriculture.

## ðŸŒ± The Vision: A Food-Secure Future

Imagine a future where every home, community, and village can produce its own nutritious, diverse food. Not through traditional farming, but with a quiet, solar-powered appliance that requires no land, minimal water, and creates zero waste.

The **TerraCoreâ„¢** system automates the cultivation of oyster mushrooms and transforms this fast-growing biomass into a wide range of familiar foods through a process of mechanical texturization and precise nutrient fortification. This is not just a new gadget; it's a pathway to resilience, sustainability, and freedom from centralized supply chains.

## ðŸš€ The TerraCoreâ„¢ Project Line

- **TerraCore Genesis Unit (Mk1)** - The current prototype: A proof-of-concept buildable with basic tools
- **Future Versions** - More advanced, automated systems built upon the Genesis Unit's success
