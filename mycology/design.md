The "Instant MycoForge" Design: Triggering Explosive Fruiting

Core Science: The pre-colonized substrate block is kept in a state of suspended animation (hibernation) inside its sealed packaging. The MycoForge chamber isn't a growing environment; it's a triggering environment that perfectly replicates the ideal conditions to end hibernation all at once.

The "Instant" Growth Cycle:

1. Hibernation State: Kit sits on shelf, mycelium dormant in its sealed bag.
2. Activation: User places the sealed block into the MycoForge and closes the lid.
3. The Trigger: The chamber instantly achieves and maintains the exact golden ratio of temperature (22°C) and humidity (90%+). This is the signal that tells every part of the mycelium: "NOW IS THE TIME. PERFECT CONDITIONS ARE HERE."
4. Explosive Fruiting: With no environmental stress or imperfection to slow it down, the mycelium invests 100% of its stored energy into fruiting body production immediately.

Result: Pins form in hours, not days. Full-sized mushrooms in 6-12 hours.

Integrating the TerraCore Thermal Core Principle

The commercial MycoForge can use a simplified, consumer-safe version of your heat regulation system.

For the Commercial Product:

· Heat Source: A small, safe, and reliable electric heating plate instead of the gasifier.
· Thermal Battery: A ceramic plate or sealed water bladder placed between the heater and the growth chamber. This is the critical component! It absorbs heat and releases it evenly, preventing hot/cold spots and maintaining the perfect ±0.5°C stability.
· Hermetic Seal: The dome clicks into a silicone gasket on the base, creating the sealed environment crucial for the triggering effect.
