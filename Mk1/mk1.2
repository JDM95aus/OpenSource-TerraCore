The MK1.2 "Universal Workhorse": A Blueprint for Freedom
This document is your complete, detailed guide to building the MK1.2. This is not a product you buy. It is a blueprint you follow. It is designed to be built using materials you find, scavenge, or repurpose from the world's endless supply of waste. The only cost is your time and effort. This technology is fundamentally FREE.

The MK1.2 is the first step in creating a fully decentralized, self-sufficient food system. It turns biological waste into a high-protein, nutritionally complete food that can be shaped and flavored to mimic virtually any other food. It is the end of hunger.

Part I: The Blueprint - A Scavenger's Guide
This is not a shopping list. This is a list of common, discarded items and their purpose.

MAIN STRUCTURE: The Growth Chamber

2x Plastic Containers: Instead of expensive food-grade buckets, use clean, salvaged five-gallon buckets or plastic containers from a local restaurant. They are often discarded and can be acquired for FREE.

1x 12V DC Fan: Salvage from an old computer tower, a broken desktop fan, or a car's radiator fan. All are excellent sources and are FREE when pulled from e-waste.

1x Ultrasonic Mist Maker: This is one of the few specialty components, but it is low-cost and can often be found in secondhand pet stores or online.

1x DHT22 Sensor + Arduino: Scavenge from an old electronic device (toy, appliance) or find a retired Arduino board. The code is open-source and FREE to download.

1x 16x2 LCD Display: Salvage from a broken home appliance, an old car stereo, or a discarded VCR.

1x Clear Plastic Sheet: Repurpose a section of a broken plexiglass picture frame, a clear plastic container, or a salvaged window pane.

1x Weather Stripping: Salvaged from a broken refrigerator door seal, an old window, or a car's trunk liner.

1x 12V Waterproof LED Strip: Scavenge from an old vehicle's interior lighting or a broken outdoor light fixture.

1x Power Adapter: Salvage a 12V DC adapter from an old laptop charger, a router, or a similar electronic device.

Relay, Breadboard, Wires: These can be salvaged from virtually any discarded electronic appliance.

PROCESSING UNIT: From Powder to Patty

Hand-Crank Grinder: Found at yard sales, thrift stores, or in the back of old kitchens. Often acquired for FREE if you ask.

Stainless Steel Bowls: Salvaged from a thrift store, a garage sale, or an old kitchen. Often acquired for FREE when you ask.

Wooden Board: Use a piece of scrap wood, an old cutting board, or a discarded pallet.

Forming Press: A simple, free hamburger press or a set of old cookie cutters.

Parchment Paper: A reusable piece of silicone mat or even a clean plastic bag from a discarded food package.

Solar Oven OR Hot Plate: Build the solar oven from an old cardboard box, aluminum foil from a discarded food container, and a pane of glass from a broken window. All are FREE.

Part II: Step-by-Step Build Instructions (For Anyone, Anywhere)
The Growth Chamber (Bio-Reactor)
Preparation: Clean all plastic containers thoroughly. Use a ruler and marker to draw a 4"x6" rectangle on the side of both buckets, ensuring they align perfectly when one is stacked on top of the other.

Cutting: Use a jigsaw or a rotary tool to carefully cut out the marked rectangles. Smooth all cut edges with a file or coarse sandpaper. Wear safety glasses.

Window Installation: Cut the acrylic sheet to fit over the openings, with a ¼" overlap on all sides. Apply a line of food-safe silicone sealant around the inside perimeter of the viewing window and press the plastic sheet firmly into place. Secure it with small, salvaged bolts or rivets.

Air & Fan System: Drill ½" holes in the bottom of the lower bucket for air intake. In the lid of the top bucket, cut a circular hole slightly smaller than the diameter of the salvaged computer fan. Secure the fan to the lid with salvaged bolts or hot glue. Cover all holes with a fine mesh screen (from an old kitchen sieve or window screen) to prevent contamination.

Environmental Control Setup: Place the ultrasonic mist maker in a small, watertight container at the bottom of the lower bucket. Mount the DHT22 sensor and LCD display on the front of the top bucket using hot glue.

Wiring: The manual provides a simple diagram for a beginner to follow. Use salvaged wires and a breadboard (or directly solder) to connect the components. Power is a simple 12V DC input.

The Processing Unit (From Muck to Meal)
Grinding Station: Mount the hand-crank grinder to the wooden board using clamps or screws. Place a clean, wide bowl underneath the grinder's spout to collect the processed powder.

Forming System: Lay out your clean, salvaged parchment paper on a flat surface. This is where you will shape your food.

Part III: Daily Operation & Troubleshooting
The MK1.2 is a simple, robust system.

Daily Operation Cycle: You simply check the unit, harvest the mature mushrooms, grind them, mix them with binders and flavors, form them into the desired shape, and cook them in the solar oven or on the hot plate.

Maintenance: The manual provides simple, clear instructions for cleaning and calibration. All of this can be done with water and basic cleaning supplies.

Troubleshooting: A simple table in the manual provides solutions for common issues, from low humidity in the chamber to a jam in the grinder.

This is not a theory. This is a blueprint for action. The MK1.2 is the starting line that empowers anyone, anywhere, to take control of their food supply and build a future free from hunger.
