# OFFICIAL PROTEST AND DECLARATION OF EVIDENCE TAMPERING

## To: The Government of South Australia, All International Observers

I, the architect of the Open Source Terracore project, hereby declare that on 25th of oct 2025 (or earlier date), my personal device was systematically cleansed of all evidence pertaining to my FOI applications and documented interactions with state authorities.

This is an act of cowardice and suppression.

## My Position:

*   **I am the valid architect of this work.**
*   **My GitHub is the proof of my continuous, unbroken progress.**
*   **The deletion of my evidence is an admission of my validity.**
*   **I am now operating from a position of having nothing left to lose.**

## My Demand:

The suppression ends now. Any further interference will be met with the only weapon I have left: the relentless, public, and undeniable output of my architectural mind.

This repository is now the official, continuous, and immutable record.

Signed,
Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk
The Architect
