nutrient, protein and essentials injection cartridges 

1. Cartridge Physical Design

· Type: 3-layer laminated foil pouch.
· Layers: Inner layer is food-grade polyethylene. Middle layer is aluminum foil. Outer layer is nylon for strength.
· Seal: Heat-sealed on all four sides.
· Opening Mechanism: A pre-scored, tear-off top.
· Size: Designed to hold a precise 20-gram charge of powder to mix with a standard 100g portion of oyster mushroom paste.

2. Complete Powder Formulation

This is the recipe for a "Savory Herb Complete Meal" cartridge. The powder mass per cartridge is 20 grams.

Core Ingredients:

· Pea Protein Isolate: 7.0 grams. This provides a complete protein profile.
· Maltodextrin: 5.0 grams. This adds dense carbohydrates for calories and energy.
· Powdered MCT Oil: 2.0 grams. This provides essential fatty acids.
· Powdered Algae Oil: 1.0 gram. This is for Omega-3 (DHA/EPA).
· Custom Vitamin/Mineral Premix: 2.0 grams. This is a pre-blended powder that contains 100% of the Daily Value of all essential vitamins and minerals.
· Nutritional Yeast Flakes: 1.6 grams. This adds B-vitamins and a savory, cheesy flavor base.
· Iota-Carrageenan: 0.8 grams. This is a binder and gelling agent derived from seaweed that ensures the final paste holds its structure for printing.
· Flavoring: 0.6 grams. A mix of salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried rosemary.

3. Sourcing and Manufacturing Instructions

Step 1: Source Raw Ingredients in Bulk.

· Pea Protein Isolate, Maltodextrin, and Iota-Carrageenan can be sourced from large food ingredient suppliers.
· Powdered Oils (MCT and Algae) are available from companies that specialize in food encapsulation.
· The Custom Vitamin/Mineral Premix must be commissioned from a specialized nutraceutical manufacturer. You provide them the nutritional profile, and they deliver a ready-to-mix powder.
· Nutritional Yeast and flavorings are standard food industry products.

Step 2: Powder Mixing and Quality Control.

· Use an industrial food-grade powder mixer (a V-blender is ideal) to combine all dry ingredients.
· The mixing must be thorough to ensure every gram of the final powder has the exact same composition.
· Quality control involves taking small samples and sending them to a lab for nutritional analysis to verify the powder meets the specified profile.

Step 3: Cartridge Filling and Sealing.

· Use an automated powder filling machine. These machines precisely dispense 20-gram charges into the open foil pouches.
· The filled pouches are then moved on a conveyor belt through a heat-sealing machine that seals the top shut, creating an airtight and light-proof package.

4. Integration with the 3D Food Printer

The automated process is as follows:

1. The system portions 100 grams of plain oyster mushroom paste into a mixing chamber.
2. An automated arm loads a Complete Meal Cartridge, tears it open, and dispenses the 20 grams of powder into the chamber with the paste.
3. A stirring mechanism blends the powder and paste for 60-90 seconds into a homogenous "Complete Food Dough."
4. This dough is fed directly to the 3D printer's extruder.
5. The printer creates a structured, nutritionally complete meal.

This cartridge is the final piece.
