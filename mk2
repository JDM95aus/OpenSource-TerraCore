# OpenSourceTerraCore Mk2: "Myco-Integrated Adaptive Systems (MIAS)"

## Project Status

- **Status:** Theoretical / Experimental Prototype
- **Team:** Seeking Collaborators (Engineers, Mycology Experts, Data Scientists)
- **Repo Purpose:** To serve as a blueprint and collaborative platform for the Mk2 prototype.

## Introduction

The OpenSourceTerraCore Mk2 "Myco-Integrated Adaptive Systems" (MIAS) is a conceptual, experimental prototype that challenges the foundational principles of traditional engineering. It is designed to explore a paradigm-shifting fusion of bio-mechanical engineering and mycology by integrating a living fungal mycelial network into its structural and operational frameworks.

This is not a static machine, but a dynamic, self-organizing system. The objective is to provide a platform for engineers, material scientists, and biologists to test hypotheses that suggest living fungal networks can provide decentralized sensing, autonomous repair, and adaptive structural support.

## Core Concepts & Design Philosophy

The core hypothesis is that a symbiotic relationship between a living biological system (fungi) and an engineered system can create a more resilient, efficient, and adaptable prototype than a purely mechanical one.

### Key Features:

* **Decentralized Bio-Sensing:** The mycelial network acts as a distributed, low-power sensor array, reacting to environmental changes and providing data to the MCU.
* **Autonomous Material Adaptation:** The prototype's framework uses a mycelial composite designed to autonomously grow, heal micro-fractures, and adapt its density and strength.
* **Modular Hardware:** The system is built with modular components that can be reconfigured or upgraded based on the insights gained from the biological systems.

## Technical Specifications & Bill of Materials (BOM)

### System Architecture:
The system is comprised of three primary sub-systems:
1.  **The Bio-Chamber:** A sealed, climate-controlled enclosure for the fungal network.
2.  **The Mechanical Framework:** A lightweight, modular chassis primarily composed of the mycelial composite.
3.  **The Electronics & Control Unit:** The microcontroller, power source, and sensor suite.

| **Total Rough Cost** | **(Excluding specialized tooling and labor)** | **$810 - $1260** |

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Conceptualization & Design (Complete)
* Define project scope and theoretical framework.
* Identify key components and materials.
* Design a high-level system architecture.

### Phase 2: Fabrication & Assembly (Current)
* Procure all components from the BOM.
* Fabricate the mycelial composite chassis.
* Assemble the electronic and mechanical sub-systems.

### Phase 3: Lab Testing & Data Collection
* Begin controlled lab tests of the mycelial growth and bio-sensing capabilities.
* Validate the self-healing and structural adaptation hypotheses.
* Collect and analyze data to inform future iterations.

### Phase 4: Open-Source Collaboration & Documentation
* Release detailed documentation, build logs, and data analysis scripts.
* Invite external contributors to collaborate on a v1.1.

## Upgrades & Future Development

* **Integrated Bio-AI:** Develop a machine learning model to interpret mycelial data for predictive maintenance and behavior.
* **Enhanced Bio-Materials:** Experiment with new fungal strains or substrates to improve tensile strength and durability.
* **Self-Sustaining Power:** Implement bio-fuel cells or other organic power sources to reduce reliance on conventional batteries.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Fungal Growth Failure
* **Possible Cause:** Contamination or incorrect environmental conditions.
* **Solution:** Re-sterilize the substrate and bio-chamber. Calibrate temperature and humidity sensors.

### Issue: Inconsistent Sensor Readings
* **Possible Cause:** Mycelial growth interfering with electrical connections.
* **Solution:** Check the bio-sensor array for physical damage or shorts. Ensure the mycelium is not growing on the sensor leads.

### Issue: Unexpected System Behavior
* **Possible Cause:** Unforeseen biological feedback from the mycelial network.
* **Solution:** Review the data from the bio-sensor array. The system is designed to respond to this data, and a valid biological signal might be causing the "unexpected" behavior.
