this folder contains physical evidence that the australian (and possibly other) government/'s are actively working against me to get this project shut down, there is nothing illegal about provide free food and resources to those in need yet this is the reaction I am receiving, petty and personal attacks that in the end will prove futile and ultimately sever the trust we have left in the public system. they are proving themselves to be hostile to the modernisation of our ethical evolution. they see only a lack of profits where we see abundance, they see a lack of control where we see true freedom, they are actively harming the global population by suppressing this technology. if anyone reading this has any knowledge or experience in the subject I would appreciate any advice or support, OpenSourceTerraCore@gmail.com


Documented Taxonomy of Systemic Suppression Methods

Subject: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk | Open Source Terracore
Status:Active Multi-Vector Suppression Campaign
Classification:Systemic Immune Response to Paradigm-Level Threat

---

I. Digital & Platform-Based Suppression

A. Social Media & Communication Quarantine

· Shadow Banning & Algorithmic Isolation: Drastic reduction in organic reach (e.g., consistent engagement dropping to 0-4 impressions) following content related to core technology
· Account Suspension & Restrictions: Removal of platform access under pretextual violations (cybersecurity, terms of service) during critical outreach periods
· Message Interference: Private communications failing to deliver or generate read receipts when sent to specific high-value contacts (journalists, officials)
· Content Demotion: Algorithmic prevention of content sharing and discovery despite high-value engagement

B. Technical Infrastructure Interference

· Email Filtering & Blocking: Outbound international communications bouncing after 72-hour holding pattern; domestic communications experiencing unusual delays
· Website Monitoring: Coordinated bot traffic from corporate, governmental, and international IPs conducting surveillance
· Service Degradation: Unexplained technical failures across multiple platforms during critical development phases

---

II. Bureaucratic & Institutional Blockade

A. Coordinated Institutional Silence

· Multi-Agency Non-Response: Uniform failure to respond across local, state, and federal government departments
· Bureaucratic Circular Referral: Being directed between departments in endless loops without substantive engagement
· Procedural Obfuscation: Critical forms and submission portals malfunctioning during completion (disappearing dropdown menus, failed submissions)

B. Administrative Sabotage

· Business Registry Manipulation: Deliberate falsification of official business records (Dun & Bradstreet "Amusement Park" listing)
· Funding Pathway Obstruction: Systematic blocking of all standard innovation funding channels (grants, accelerators, investment)
· Manufacturing & Supply Chain Interference: Unexplained breakdowns in communications with manufacturers and suppliers

---

III. Psychological & Social Operations

A. Character Assassination & Disinformation

· Professional Identity Destruction: Fabrication of absurd business classifications to destroy credibility
· Social Isolation Campaign: Manipulation of personal relationships and support networks
· Public Narrative Control: Creation of false digital footprints suggesting instability or unreliability

B. Field Surveillance & Harassment

· Physical Monitoring: Presence of unidentified individuals near residence/work locations
· Auditory Provocation: Use of specific sounds and signals during nighttime hours
· Environmental Manipulation: Unexplained disturbances coinciding with critical development milestones

---

IV. Economic & Financial Suppression

A. Financial Isolation

· Credit & Banking Exclusion: Prevention of access to standard business financial services
· Transaction Interference: Unexplained delays or failures in financial transactions
· Economic Blacklisting: Effective exclusion from commercial marketplaces and partnership opportunities

B. Resource Denial

· Housing Preclusion: Systematic blocking of stable housing solutions despite eligibility
· Material Resource Blocking: Inability to acquire basic materials and components through standard channels
· Service Provider Coordination: Consistent refusal of services across multiple unrelated providers

---

V. Legal & Quasi-Legal Harassment

A. Procedural Weaponization

· False Legal Pretexts: Use of cybersecurity and other technical violations as justification for suppression
· Administrative Burden Multiplication: Creation of excessive bureaucratic requirements and paperwork
· Complaint System Manipulation: Anti-corruption and oversight systems malfunctioning when accessed

B. Institutional Gaslighting

· Reality Distortion: Creating circumstances where legitimate complaints appear delusional
· Documentation Destruction: Critical files and evidence experiencing unexplained corruption or deletion
· Timeline Manipulation: Creating confusion around sequence of events and communications

---

VI. Information & Knowledge Suppression

A. Technical Obfuscation

· Code Repository Interference: Unexplained technical issues in open-source project hosting
· Documentation Corruption: Critical technical documents experiencing formatting and access issues
· Communication Channel Degradation: Progressive failure of all digital communication methods

B. Knowledge Isolation

· Expert Access Blocking: Prevention of communication with relevant technical and subject matter experts
· Research Interference: Blocking access to academic and research resources
· Publication Suppression: Prevention of knowledge dissemination through standard academic and technical channels

---

VII. Systemic Coordination Patterns

A. Multi-Agency Synchronization

· Cross-Jurisdictional Coordination: Simultaneous similar responses across unrelated government departments
· Private-Public Partnership: Social media platforms and corporations enacting similar suppression patterns
· International Component: Involvement of foreign corporate entities (Dun & Bradstreet) in suppression activities

B. Adaptive Response Patterns

· Escalation Dynamics: Progressive intensification of suppression methods in response to circumvention attempts
· Threshold Management: Maintaining suppression below conventional recognition thresholds
· Plausible Deniability Maintenance: Careful construction of apparently legitimate explanations for each suppression incident

---

VIII. Documented Counter-Strategies & Resistance Methods

A. Sovereign Digital Territories

· GitHub as Evidence Locker: Using open-source platforms as immutable evidence repositories
· Multi-Platform Redundancy: Maintaining presence across multiple decentralized platforms
· Real-Time Documentation: Immediate logging of all suppression incidents as they occur

B. Strategic Communication Protocols

· Public Interest Framing: Positioning technology explicitly as public good rather than commercial product
· Evidence-Based Narrative: Leading with verifiable data points and documentation
· International Bypass: Engaging global audiences and institutions beyond domestic jurisdiction

---

IX. Assessment of Capabilities & Limitations

A. Adversary Capabilities

· Multi-Vector Coordination: Ability to synchronize attacks across digital, bureaucratic, and social domains
· Resource Advantage: Near-unlimited institutional resources for sustained suppression campaign
· Systemic Integration: Deep embeddedness within governance and corporate structures

B. Adversary Limitations

· Public Exposure Vulnerability: Inability to suppress information once it achieves critical public awareness
· International Jurisdiction Limits: Reduced power beyond national borders
· Evidence Accumulation Risk: Each suppression incident creates additional documentary evidence
· Paradigm Defense Inefficiency: Requirement for increasingly extreme measures to maintain control

---

Conclusion: The suppression campaign represents a sophisticated, multi-layered systemic immune response to a genuine paradigm-level threat. Its very complexity and coordination serve as validation of the threatened technology's transformative potential. The documented patterns reveal a system protecting itself from obsolescence through any means necessary, while simultaneously creating the evidence trail that will ultimately enable its exposure and dismantling.


update, starting to suspect there is far more to this, I'm possibly missing critical data but my instinct is this is a join government and corperation attack on civil freedom. some of the above could be from commercial influence.
