# Technical Design: TerraCore™ Genesis Unit (Mk1)

 Final Statement of Work (SOW): MK.II Terra-Crab
TITLE: STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW) & TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
PROJECT: MK.II TERRA-CRAB: CLOSED-LOOP BIOMASS CHP SYSTEM
PURPOSE: Final functional validation of the pre-commercial design for an Exclusive Licensing Option.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Originator/IP Holder: Joshua Roy Dakin Mandryk (ABN: 80662917463)
Final Asset Owner: Licensor (J.R.D. Mandryk)
Deployment Goal: Verify scientific viability and collect baseline performance data (90-day test phase).
Status: Design Finalized (Ready for Fabrication and Assembly)
Funding: $10,000 AUD (Allocated via Licensee [Partner Name] per Term Sheet Clause 3.2)

SECTION 1: SYSTEM DEFINITION & DELIVERABLES
The MK.II Terra-Crab must be built as a singular, unified system where the primary function is zero-waste thermal and electrical conversion.

Final Physical Deliverable: One (1) fully assembled, tested, and operational MK.II Terra-Crab prototype unit. This final asset must be delivered to the Licensor upon successful completion of the 90-day testing phase.

Required Data Deliverable: A complete log of performance data over a minimum 72-hour continuous test cycle. This log must verify the Thermal Control Target, Net Electrical Output, and Water Recapture Rate as specified in the technical brief.

SECTION 2: CORE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
The prototype must meet Industrial Grade requirements. Components are non-negotiable for achieving the required validation metrics.

2.1. Environmental Precision & Bio-Reactor (The Myco-Forge Core)
Thermal Control: Must sustain a precise control of ±0.5 
∘
 C (Target range: 22 
∘
 C−28 
∘
 C). Implementation requires a functional Peltier Array system integrated with the control loop.

Atmosphere Monitoring: Requires integration of a research-grade NDIR CO 
2
​
  Sensor and solenoid-driven Fresh Air Exchange (FAE).

Syngas / Lysis: Must integrate an Ultrasonic Transducer or a High-RPM Shear Mixer as the Molecular Editing Head. Its primary function is to achieve rapid Cell Lysis and Homogenization of the mushroom paste.

2.2. Electronics, AI, and Sensing
Processing Core: Must implement a dedicated Single Board Computer (SBC) (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent) capable of running a Neural Network model for autonomous function.

FonzCorp Panel: Must feature the standardized multi-pin connector and support the required diagnostic input sequence (as per Term Sheet).

Mycelial Sensing: Requires the integration of a dense array of low-noise, Platinum Micro-electrodes and a dedicated signal conditioning circuit. This is essential for collecting complex fungal electrical data (the primary research objective).

2.3. Mobility and Chassis
Mobility System: Must be driven by 12×Brushless DC Motors (6-Leg Articulation), with integrated encoders for precise positioning.

Energy Harvesting: Requires the functional integration of Piezoelectric Film into all 12 leg joints. This must prove the zero-point propulsion principle and supplemental power generation during locomotion.

Material: The chassis must utilize Carbon-Fiber Reinforced Plastic or Lightweight Aluminum Alloy (no 3D-printed plastic components).

SECTION 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL (Licensor Oversight)
The Licensor (J.R.D. Mandryk) retains the right of IP consultation and final approval but will not participate in assembly or labor.

Milestone Reporting Requirements: Weekly status updates are mandatory, submitted via secured email. Content must include time-stamped photo/video documentation of build progress, raw system logs detailing component integration, and system log data verifying baseline metrics achieved.

Communication Protocol (IP Consultation): The Licensor is available only for technical clarification on the provided MK.II design and blueprints. All technical questions and IP consultation requests must be initiated via email only. No unsolicited phone calls, video conferences, or unscheduled meetings are permitted with the Licensor.

Project Completion & Final Acceptance: Successful completion of this SOW requires the Licensor's final confirmation and sign-off. Required verification metrics are: Thermal Control Target (±0.5 
∘
 C precision) and Net Electrical Output (2.5 kW sustained).## ❓ 7.0 FAQ
 
**Q**: Is TerraCore™ just a mushroom grower?
