# Technical Design: The Self-Sustaining Food Synthesizer

## 🎯 1.0 Abstract & Vision
An open-source, solar-powered hardware system that automates decentralized food production. Grows oyster mushroom biomass and transforms it into diverse, nutritious foods through mechanical texturization and precision fortification.

## 🏗️ 2.0 System Architecture
The system follows a linear production pipeline where solar energy powers everything. Mushrooms grow in climate-controlled chambers, get harvested by robots, then move to synthesis modules that transform the biomass into finished food. All controlled by a central AI system.

**Production Flow:** Sun → Solar → Batteries → Growth → Harvest → Synthesis → Food

## ⚙️ 3.0 Core Modules

### 🔋 3.1 Power & Energy Management
- **Solar Array**: 400W scalable panels with smart charging
