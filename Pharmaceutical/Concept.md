pharmaceutical version: Malaria-Core Module Specification

Overview

The Malaria-Core is a pharmaceutical production module for The OpenSourceTerraCore Project platform that enables decentralized manufacturing of Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) precursors in remote, low-infrastructure environments.

Target Disease

· Disease: Malaria (Plasmodium falciparum)
· Annual Impact: 600,000+ deaths globally
· Current Limitation: Broken supply chains for effective treatments in endemic regions

Technical Specifications

Core Components

1. Precision Thermal System (Unmodified from Base Platform)

· Provides ±0.5°C thermal stability
· Off-grid power generation via gasifier
· Maintains optimal fermentation temperature (30°C)

2. Bio-Forge Fermentation Cartridge

· Organism: Engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast strain EPY224/224A)
· Process: Aerobic fermentation producing artemisinic acid
· Cycle Time: 48-72 hours per batch
· Capacity: 5L working volume per cartridge
· Output: Artemisinic acid broth (precursor to Artemisinin)

3. Pharmaceutical Synthesis Module

Replaces standard culinary assembler with:

Extraction & Conversion Unit

· Photochemical conversion (450nm LEDs)
· Solvent-based extraction system
· Automated purification chromatography

Formulation System

· Powder mixing and compaction
· Tablet pressing capability
· Sterile packaging output

Production Workflow

1. Fermentation Phase
   · Load fermentation cartridge with engineered yeast strain
   · Maintain 30°C for 48-72 hours
   · Monitor pH and dissolved oxygen
2. Extraction & Conversion
   · Separate yeast biomass from broth
   · Photochemical conversion to Artemisinin
   · Purification via column chromatography
3. Formulation
   · Combine Artemisinin with partner drug (e.g., Piperaquine)
   · Powder mixing and tablet formation
   · Quality verification via UV spectrophotometry

Yield Specifications

· Theoretical Yield: 25g Artemisinin per 5L batch
· Expected Practical Yield: 15-20g per batch
· Treatment Courses: ~150-200 adult treatment courses per batch

Advantages Over Conventional Production

Supply Chain Resilience

· Eliminates 12-18 month plantation-to-pill timeline
· Reduces dependency on Artemisia annua crop availability
· Prevents counterfeit medication distribution

Technical Advantages

· Utilizes existing platform thermal precision
· Modular cartridge system prevents cross-contamination
· Scalable production through multiple cartridge operation

Regulatory Pathway

· Initial focus on API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) production
· Local formulation under existing medical licenses
· Simplified approval as decentralized manufacturing unit

Required Modifications from Base Platform

1. Replace culinary assembler with pharmaceutical synthesis unit
2. Implement UV spectrophotometer for quality control
3. Add sterile packaging subsystem
4. Update control software for fermentation protocols

Applications

· Remote clinic pharmaceutical production
· Emergency response units
· Humanitarian aid deployments
· Regional healthcare centers in endemic areas

Notes

This system leverages published synthetic biology research (Paddon et al., 2013) and adapts it for decentralized manufacturing. All biological components use established, documented strains.
